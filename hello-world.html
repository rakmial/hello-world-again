<h1> Hello World </h1>
<h2> A(nother) program to greet the planet. </h2>

<p>
    I'm not really supposed to spend much time on this page, but writing is therapeutic, yes?
    Since high school, I've been a Linux user. I built my first computer with money I earned
    working part-time at a pizza shop at sixteen years old. The rest of my earnings capitalized into
    a 2005 Buell Blast, a stint in Germany staying with an exchange student, and sufficient cushion
    to land me gently in community college.
</p>

<p>
    College was an incredible period for me, but I worked 20-30 hours per week through 
    school, and I regret the time I could have spent building community, personal projects, and understanding
    what I really wanted out of life. It goes by quick when you're busy, busy, busy.

    "Hello World" has become bittersweet for me. I have written it many times, in many languages and frameworks.
    Today, I write again directly between /<p> tags, like I don't know any number of automarkup tools exist.
    Do I dare enumerate how many times I've done this dance?
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        High school - Linux, bash, HTML/CSS/JS/php - "Hello, world!" felt so optimistic.
    </li>
    <li>
        College - Java, C, Python, R - "Hello, world!" was common ground, delving deeper, but never feeling complete.
    </li>
    <li>
        Post-college - (Data Analysis phase) pandas, sk-learn, SQL - "Hello, world!" was a welcome home after working in jobs I didn't want,
        but somehow I couldn't manage to get a junior position in the hottest hiring field there was. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Today - Ruby, React - "Hello, world!" gives me anxiety. I've spent half my life trying to get the world to notice me. I'm still trying,
        because this is truly what I want to be doing.
    </li>
</ol>

    Some sob story, but it's mine. Had I wealthy benefactors, it might have been different. As it is, I'm borrowing the FOSS curriculum
    from Epicodus rather than committing thousands in the era of COVID to do it for real. To any reading this - wish me luck?
</p>

<p>PS: I don't usually complain so much, especially publicly, but starting this whole adventure again
    clearly has me feeling vulnerable. Thank you for indulging my whinging and somehow making it through all of it.
